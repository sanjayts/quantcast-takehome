    The choice of data structures for this particular implementation is specifically chosen for the purpose of fastest
    retrieval for the most frequent cookie. The presence of a priority queue (or a heap) allows us to quickly pick the
    most frequent cookie O(logN) while at the same time taking up memory linear to the total cookie count. The drawback
    here being each insert into the heap taking up O(logN) time which becomes a total of O(NlogN) insert for the
    entire cookie population as opposed to O(N) for a pure map based approach.

    This is different from the naive hash map approach which would need to traverse all the cookies for a given date
    which in the worst case of a single date and only-once-present cookie will degrade into a linear scan.

    That's not to say this implementation is ideal for all use-cases (what about top K? What about cases wherein a
    small number of unique cookies occur numerous times?). It's all about trade-offs!
